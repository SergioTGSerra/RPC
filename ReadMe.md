In this work, an RPC system in Python for image processing was presented. ​

The system allows the client to send an image and processing specifications to the server, which performs operations such as converting to grayscale, resizing and rotating the image. ​

The system also allows asynchronous image processing, where the client can check the status and result of the task using a unique ID.​

We use the PILLOW library to work with images and create a Dockerfile to install as necessary dependencies.​

The system can be useful for applications that require fast and efficient image processing.
